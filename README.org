Want a setup so that overfitting to noise in train data is
observed. That does not work with two constant values because they
become better approximation of validation data as bin size is decreased.

which shows that if we fill in validation regions with two constant
values (first half from prior data point, second half from next data
point), then the min valid loss always happens for small bin sizes,
and small penalty values (too many peaks).
