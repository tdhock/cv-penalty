- Figures showing qualitatively what happens when shuffling.

** 17 Feb 2022

Want a setup so that overfitting to noise in train data is
observed. That does not work with two constant values because they
become better approximation of validation data as bin size is
decreased. Try permuting one fold of bins in

Figure above shows encouraging results. At smallest bin size (10
bases) min valid loss results in log penalty of 8.0221 and a
reasonable number of peaks (11). Should we also look at other metrics?
Should we try different number of folds? (this was with 3)

Below was original experiment which seemed not very convincing... min
valid loss on smallest bin size had too many peaks...

[[file:figure-search-valid-min-fill-two-constant.R]] makes

[[file:figure-search-valid-min-fill-two-constant.png]]

which shows that if we fill in validation regions with two constant
values (first half from prior data point, second half from next data
point), then the min valid loss always happens for small bin sizes,
and small penalty values (too many peaks).
